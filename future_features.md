Listed in terms of priority
- Have the ability to delete and update module items
- Have better failure management for query errors. A simple fix would be testing connection before attempting to push and pull data
- Do testing on other item types in modules, like assignments, quizzes, files, etc. Make sure they work and add fixes if they don't (files in particular seem to break across courses).
- Optimize things to improve speed (memoisation in querying Canvas?)
